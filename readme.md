# Correlation Filters for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Aerial Tracking: A Review and Experimental Evaluation

### Changhong Fu, Bowen Li, Fangqiang Ding, Fuling Lin, and Geng Lu



This code library gives our experimental results and most of the publicly available DCF-based trackers.

The trackers are in folder **tracker_set** and the results are in **all_trk_result**.

In folder **demo**, we offer an example on how to utilize the trackers in this code library and how to implement the tracking procedure.

The trackers are tested on the following platform.

- windows 10 64-bit
- Intel Core i7-8700K（3.70GHz）
- 32G RAM
- Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080
- Matlab 2019a
- CUDA10
- VS2017

**All the DCF-based trackers' results are obtained using a single CPU with a single core.**

## UAVDT_Comparision against deep trackers

The deep trackers used GPU acceleration, while the DCF-based tracker AutoTrack used a **single CPU only**.
